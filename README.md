# HR Analytics Dashboard  
**Uncovering Key Drivers of Employee Attrition and Workforce Retention**


## 📌 Project Overview  
This HR Analytics project analyzes employee data from IBM to identify the key factors influencing **employee attrition** and overall workforce satisfaction.  

The dashboard provides actionable insights that help HR departments:  
- Understand why employees leave  
- Identify high-risk segments  
- Make data-driven decisions to improve retention  

The analysis was conducted using **Microsoft Excel**, leveraging pivot tables, slicers, and visual dashboards for clarity and interactivity.


## 🎯 Business Problem  
Employee attrition poses a significant challenge for most organizations, leading to higher recruitment costs and productivity loss.  
This project aims to answer the following key questions:  

1. What is the current employee attrition rate?  
2. Which departments experience the highest turnover?  
3. Are there patterns in attrition based on income, age, or job satisfaction?  
4. How can HR take proactive steps to improve retention?

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** → Data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation
- **Power Query** → For data cleaning, data transformation and data integration
- **Pivot Tables** → For summarizing attrition trends by department, age, income, and job role  
- **Excel Charts & Slicers** → For interactive visualization and filtering  
- **Statistical Analysis** – Attrition rate calculations and segmentation
